"""The scene-import model: the game's own scene list with its own names, split
the way the game itself splits it, and the placements of whichever piece is
selected.

Nothing here reads the game. Which containers carry a scene's name, which place
belongs to which map, and how the ids group are stated by the hook
(``endfield.scene.maps`` / ``endfield.scene.landmarks``); this module holds the
selection they feed.

The split between the two kinds of scene is the game's own, not a guess from
names. Its map UI publishes one entry per place it can display, each with a world
rect and an ``isSingleLevel`` flag (see EndfieldSceneLandmarks in
Ruri.RipperHook). A place that is its own level is a SELF-CONTAINED scene, small
enough to load whole. A place that is not belongs to the open-world map whose id
it starts with, and that map is a STREAMING scene: far too big to hold at once
(map02 whole is 26811 CABs), so it is imported one named place at a time, at the
size the game itself gives that place.

Same reasoning as cabmap_state for holding this as plain data: a real map's
placement count runs into the hundreds of thousands and is only ever read in bulk
(discover -> estimate -> resolve -> import), never edited row by row.
