"""Endfield (Arknights: Endfield) -- everything the add-on has for this game and
nothing else, across every hooked version of it.

Two tabs, neither of which means anything for another title:

``StreamingScene``  the game's own scenes, every kind it ships, switched inside
               the tab: ``Scene`` the self-contained ones -- pick one from the
               game's own list and import it whole; ``World`` the open-world maps
               -- pick one of the places the game itself names in map01/map02 and
               import that place, at the size the game gives it, out of the game's
               own chunk format; ``UI`` the lit little stages an interface stands
               a model on (CharInfo, CharFormation, WeaponInfo), loaded around a
               character already in the scene.
               (``scene`` + ``scene_state``;
                ``ui_scene`` for the UI half, which is the
                one part that needs a scene to load a stage AROUND)
``Character``  the cast, and what can be done to the one you loaded. Its own row
               switches what the tab lists: ``Characters``/``NPCs`` the two casts,
               ``Story`` the animations story playback uses, filed the way the game
               files them -- a cutscene by shot / kind / actor, a dialogue timeline
               by spoken line. Under it, the SkeletalMorph facial system: browse
               the emotion/pose/lipsync library, bind its ctrl drivers to a rig,
               bake its animations. Each SECTION asks for what it needs, so a host
               with no rigs still gets the cast.
               (``character`` composing ``roster`` + ``story`` +
                ``face``; ``skeletal_morph`` + ``morph_state``)

All of it lives here, including the parts that touch no bpy: the game's
addressable-path conventions and its studio-written MonoBehaviour schemas are
still ONE GAME'S facts, and ``Kernel`` -- shared with a host that has no
such feature -- may not carry them.

Declared as one GAME_MODULE row (see ``Game``), so the core panel reveals both tabs
exactly while the install in front of it IS Endfield, and never names this game
itself.
