"""Put one story unit on stage: walk the game's own directive stream and build it.

The hook reads the unit's Timeline and hands back a STAGE -- rows that say what to
do, in seconds, against names (``endfield.story.stage``). Nothing in that stream is
Unity-shaped, so nothing here has to know what an ``ActivationTrack`` is; it knows
what ``show`` means, and there is exactly one function that means it.

That is the whole architecture: a directive kind is a key of the ``REALIZERS`` point
and a function under ``@realizer``. Supporting something the game adds later is one new
function and no edit to anything that already works -- which is the property the
previous design did not have, since every track class was another branch inside one
operator.

WHAT IS BUILT, and why each is the shape it is:

``motion``    an NLA strip on the rig / camera / stand-in the timeline binds it to.
              Timeline states (start, duration, clipIn, speed) in SECONDS against
              the clip's own sample rate; a strip states frames plus the action
              frames it eats. The conversion is exact, not fitted.
``camera``    the unit films through ONE camera whose animation is a sequence of
              shot clips -- so a cut is a clip boundary, and pressing play cuts
              exactly where the game cuts. That camera becomes ``scene.camera``:
              the game's main camera, which is what makes playback need no setup.
``show``      keyframed visibility, constant interpolation, because activation is a
              switch and a state smoothed between two states is one the game never
              shows.
``line``      a real 3D text object parented to that camera, visible exactly across
              its own span. Renderable on purpose: a viewport overlay cannot be
              rendered, and a story you cannot render is half a story.
``beats``     ``line``/``click``/``hold``/``jump``/``option`` also land on the scene
              as a script of BEATS. That is what the player reads to advance the
              story a click at a time, and it is scene data rather than module
              state so a saved .blend still plays.

Everything else the timeline carries that a host cannot literally play -- an audio
event, a mask, a logo -- becomes a timeline marker at its own second. Named and
timed is the honest answer; silently dropped is not.
